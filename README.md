# Sensor-Fusion-Perception

**Harris Corner Detector: Implemented a Harris' corner detector from scratch in python.**


**Extended Kalman Filter based Monocular SLAM: **
A typical EKF based monocular SLAM system ScenelibLinks to an external site. is first given by Andrew. J. DavisonLinks to an external site. in the paper " MonoSLAM: Real-Time Single Camera SLAMLinks to an external site.". Currently, a whole new RT-SLAMLinks to an external site. system is put forward by Joan Sol√†Links to an external site. etc., which can dealing multiple sensor fusion including vision in real-time. For most vision based SLAM systems, the camera state is comprised of position, rotation quaternion, velocity and angular velocity of the camera, and the feature state is represented by a 3D world coordinates.
